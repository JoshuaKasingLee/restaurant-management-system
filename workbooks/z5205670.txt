Week 1
Group formed. I wrote the manager user stories. Together with James, 
I constructed the flow diagram and started on story boards. While he focused 
on the staff interfaces, I focused on the customer interface. 

Week 2
I cleaned up user stories after clarifying choices as a group. Together with 
James, I determined the details of the game we were going to design. I added 
the game elements to the flow diagram and finished the customer interface story 
boards.

Week 3
I finished up the customer flow diagram and storyboards for the proposal. 
I wrote out all the customer routes and endpoints so that the frontend and
backend can be connected easily. I set up the frontend in github and started 
coding the landing page, table selection page and menu page.
