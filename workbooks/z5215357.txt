Week 1
In the tute, we formed our group, chose our project and delegated developer roles this week.
Josh and I wrote the customer user stories.
I grouped all the user stories into distinct functionalities/objectives.
We had a team meeting, where we reviewed all of the user stories, and assigned them all story points and priorities.
We decided sprint dates, and allocated user stories to each sprint.
I researched into different frameworks and libraries to use for our website backend, and also started brainstorming and
designing a database schema for key objects in our project (e.g. menu, tables, orders, etc.)

Week 2
In the tute, we checked our user stories and progress with the tutor, and made changes as suggested.
The backend team (Josh, Cyrus and I) helped each other set up set up PostgresSQL, psycopg and Flask,
and set up our backend solution, making sure it was running in preparation for Sprint 1 next week.
The backend team worked together to design a database schema, and came up with UML diagram to show how our objects would interact.
We also split up user stories for Sprint 1, where I am in charge of the backend for stories under Functionality 2 & 5.
I wrote about the problem our project tackles, and novelties it brings in the proposal.

Week 3
This week we began Sprint 1.
Josh, Cyrus and I created a script to initialise the database, and started filling it with test data.
I ran into issues with the database, so Josh helped me to troubleshoot and get it working.
I created boilerplate constructors for all of our objects.
I started working on the testing and code for user stories 5.3 & 5.4.
I wrote about each of the 5 types of users of our system, and created a diagram to demonstrate the user flows in the proposal.
