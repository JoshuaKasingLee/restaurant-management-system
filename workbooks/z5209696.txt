Week 1
Group was formed. Our team discussed and decided which project we wanted to complete for the course. I am part of the backend team with Cyrus and Kelly. Kelly and I wrote the customer user stories together.
Cyrus, Kelly and I started thinking about what frameworks/languages we wanted to use for the backend (database layer and business layer).  
Week 2
Cyrus, Kelly and I brainstormed ideas about how our SQL schema should look like as well as the UML diagram all individually and collaborated our ideas in a meeting to finalise it. We also helped each other set up PostgresSQL, psycopg and Flask
in preparation for the sprint starting in week 3.
